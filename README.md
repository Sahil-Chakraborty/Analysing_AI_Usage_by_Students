## 📌 Key Conclusions  

The analysis reveals several clear insights into AI assistant usage patterns:

* **AI Assistance Level** vs **Satisfaction** – Higher assistance levels (4–5) consistently yield higher satisfaction ratings, showing a **direct correlation** between guidance depth and user contentment.

* **Task Type vs Session Length** – **Brainstorming** sessions tend to last longer than other tasks, suggesting deeper engagement, whereas **Coding** and   **Writing** have moderately long sessions.

* **Discipline vs Total Prompts** – **Computer Science**, **Psychology**, and **Biology** disciplines show the highest average prompts, indicating heavier reliance on AI for academic support.

* **Student Level vs Task Usage** – **Undergraduates** dominate AI usage across all task types, especially in **Writing** and **Studying**, while **High School** and **Graduate** users show balanced but lower activity.
